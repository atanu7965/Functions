        "1. What is the difference between a function and a method in Python ?\n",
        "   - A method is a function that is associated with an object or class, whereas a function is a standalone block of code. Methods are called using dot notation on an object (e.g., my_object.my_method()) and are implicitly passed the object they are called on as the first argument (often named self). Functions are called by their name (e.g., my_function()) and are independent of any object.\n",
        "\n",
        "   1. Function Example\n",
        "     - def add(a, b):\n",
        "\n",
        "       return a + b\n",
        "\n",
        "        result = add(5, 3)\n",
        "\n",
        "        print(result)   **# Output: 8**\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n",
        "   - In Python, a parameter is a variable listed inside the parentheses of a function definition, acting as a placeholder for a value. An argument is the actual value that is passed to the function when it is called, and this value is assigned to the corresponding parameter for use within the function.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Example:-\n",
        "\n",
        "    def add_numbers(num1, num2):\n",
        "\n",
        "     \"\"\"This function adds two numbers.\"\"\"\n",

        "\n",
        "3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n",
        "   - You define a Python function using the def keyword, followed by the function name, parentheses (), and a colon :. The code inside the function must be indented. You call a function by writing its name followed by parentheses, with any required arguments inside the parentheses.\n",

        "\n",
        "You can capture the returned value by assigning the function call to a variable.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "4. What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?\n",
        "    - The return statement in a Python function is used to exit the function and send a value back to the caller. This allows you to use the function's result for further calculations or processing elsewhere in your code. If a function doesn't have a return statement, or if return is used without a value, it automatically returns None.\n",

        "    print(result * 2)\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
        "   - An iterable is an object that can be looped over, like a list or string, while an iterator is an object that keeps track of the position during iteration and provides the next item. The main difference is that an iterable can be iterated over multiple times, but an iterator is a single-use object that maintains its state and uses the __next__() method to return the next item. Every iterator is an iterable, but not every iterable is an iterator.\n",
        "- Example\n",
        "# An iterable\n",
        "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",

        "# Using the next() function on the iterator\n",
        "print(next(my_iterator)) # Output: 1\n",

        "\n",
        "# The iterator remembers its state\n",

        "6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
        "    - Generators are functions that produce a sequence of values one at a time, saving memory by not creating the entire sequence at once. They are defined like normal functions but use the yield keyword instead of return to produce a value and pause execution. When called, they return a generator object, which can be iterated over using a for loop or the next() function.\n",

        "\n",
        "Use the yield keyword: Inside the function, use yield to return a value. The yield keyword saves the function's state and pauses its execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Resume execution: When the next value is requested, the function resumes from where it left off, after the yield statement.\n",
        "\n",
        "Return a generator object: When the generator function is called, it returns a generator object, which is an iterator.\n",

        "7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "   - Generators offer several advantages over regular functions, primarily related to memory efficiency and handling large or infinite sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "Advantages of Generators:\n",
        "Memory Efficiency: Generators produce values one at a time using the yield keyword, rather than storing all values in memory like a regular function that returns a list. This is crucial when dealing with very large datasets or infinite sequences, as it prevents excessive memory consumption.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lazy Evaluation: Values are generated only when requested, on demand. This \"lazy\" evaluation can save processing time if not all values in a sequence are needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Handling Infinite Sequences: Generators can easily represent infinite sequences (e.g., all even numbers, the Fibonacci sequence) because they don't need to store the entire sequence in memory. They simply yield the next value in the sequence as requested.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cleaner Code for Iterators: Generators simplify the creation of iterators. You don't need to explicitly implement __iter__() and __next__() methods, as yield handles the iteration protocol automatically.\n",
        "\n",
        "Pipelining Operations: Multiple generators can be chained together to form a processing pipeline, where the output of one generator serves as the input for the next, facilitating efficient data transformation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "Consider generating a sequence of squares.\n",
        "\n",
        "def generate_squares_list(n):\n",

        "\n",
        "# Calling the function and storing the entire list in memory\n",
        "my_squares = generate_squares_list(1000000)\n",
        "# This list can consume a significant amount of memory\n",
        "\n",
        "8.  What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
        "    - A lambda function in Python is a small, anonymous function defined using the lambda keyword. Unlike regular functions defined with def, lambda functions do not have a name and are typically used for short, one-time operations. They can take any number of arguments but can only have one expression, which is implicitly returned.\n",

        "   - Purpose:\n",
